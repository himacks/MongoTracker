GOALS

- Need to somehow add a way so that you can add sub entries in a single trade, this will allow people to enter secondary entries like adding dips or adding to winners, one way to this is adding a + button next to the remove column, and then it expands the current row showing options to add another entry etc.
- figured out how to do this, add a plus button on main entry to add legs, add a settings button to show settings like auto calculate fields or leave for manual, make legs separate entries or exists or do cost averaging, etc.
