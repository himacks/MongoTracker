"# MongoTracker" 

Next Steps:

- Figure out how to update an existing object in Mongo DB
- Figure out how to create a new object in data base upon a new entry on a new row
    - when object is created have the server return the object ID back to the cell and every cell in the row so that duplicate objects in that row are not made and rather it becomes an updating object.
- Figure out how to delete rows which also send a request to delete the item from the database
